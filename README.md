Practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas to extract and transform
the data.

After transform the data, create FOUR csv files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema.  Upload the CSV file data into a Postgrest database

To create a database.  inspect the four csv and sketch an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBD

## Crowdfunding ##

**CROWDFUNDING** involves financing a project or enterprise by collecting funds from a vast pool of individuals, often through online platforms. This approach falls under the umbrella of crowdsourcing and alternative financial methods. A growing array of people, spanning from independent content producers to renowned figures, are embracing crowdfunding as a way to launch fresh products and generate enthusiasm. Nonetheless, not all endeavors meet with triumph. To secure funding, a project must reach or exceed its initial objective, leading many organizations to invest substantial resources in their pursuit of deciphering the key to achieving success through an in-depth examination of previous undertakings.

## Project Overview ##

The guidelines for this project are organized into the subsequent segments:

1. Formulate the DataFrames for Categories and Subcategories
2. Construct the DataFrame for Campaigns
3. Establish the DataFrame for Contacts
4. Establish the Crowdfunding Database

## Project Methods ##

In this project-

- We created a repository for this project and named Crowdfunding_ETL, and cloned it to our loacl computer.
- we employed the following programming languages, software, and libraries:
   - python, postgres, pandas, JSON, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, QuickDBD,  NumPy, RegEx
- We created the Category and Subcategory, Campaign, and Contacts Dataframes.
- Finally, we created the Crowdfunding database using the above mentioned Dataframes.
